# Filament Scale # 

## Overview ##   
Created to easily determine the weight and length of 3D printing filament left on a spool. It is made using 3D printed parts as well as various electronics, and is padded with silicone molds. There are 4 modes coded into the scale, 3 of which are for removing the weight of different spools, and 1 to be used as a normal scale.
